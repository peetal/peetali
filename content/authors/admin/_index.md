I am pursuing my PhD degree in psychology (specialized in cognitive neuroscience) at Universtiy of Oregon. My works focus on modeling, measuring and predicting human attention and attention-related beahviors. I apply machine learning algorithms in combined with inferential statistics to make sense of the data and infer cogntive processes from the data.
